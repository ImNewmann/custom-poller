# custom-poller

This is a custom polling function that i wrote when working at jet2. It was used with the optimizely A/B testing platform. The idea is to create a way of selecting DOM elements and values from the datalayer, which are then accessed by the window object and manipulated in a separate js file when serving the user a different experience.
