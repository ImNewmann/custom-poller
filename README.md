# custom-poller

This is a custom utilities functions that i wrote when working with the optimizely A/B testing platform at jet2. The utils file contains a custom poller that polls for DOM elements and values from the datalayer, which are then accessed by the window object and manipulated in a separate js file when serving the user a different experience.
